# Here is your baby-steps into a world of _clips6_

### Prelimenary steps

1. Did you read [Installation instructions](INSTALL.md) ?
2. Did you compile and install the module ?
3. Did you successfully run the *Test Suite* as explained in [Installation instructions](INSTALL.md) ?

If all prelimenary questions are answered *"YES"*, then you do have a working clips6 environment on your host

### Step #1

*Import the module*

```python
import clips6
```
This shall be your obvious first step.

### Step #2

*Create the Environment*

```python
import clips6
env = clips6.ENV()
```

clips6 Environment is close analog of the CLIPS environments and this is your main _"workhorse"_

### Step #3

*Hello World*

```python
import clips6
env = clips6.ENV()
shell = env.SHELL()
shell.EXEC('(printout t "Hello from clips6 world!" crlf )')
```
The latter call will print a friendly message on the screen and will return _True_, indicating that the execution of the CLIPS statement were succesful. You will also figure-out that if you want to work with CLIPS shell from clips6 module, you have to create a _shell object_ by calling method _SHELL()_ of your environment.
