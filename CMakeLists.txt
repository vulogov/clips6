# With CMake, a clean separation can be made between the source tree and the
# build tree.  When all source is compiled, as with pure C/C++, the source is
# no-longer needed in the build tree.  However, with pure *.py source, the
# source is processed directly.  To handle this, we reproduce the availability
# of the source files in the build tree.
