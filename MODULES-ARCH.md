![clips6 Architecture](documents/CLIPS6-ARCH.jpg?raw=true)

Let's take a brief overview of thow the Python-coded function getting exposed to a CLIPS world:

1. clips6 itself is written on Cython, which is fully compartible with the regular CPython (for all our oractical purposes), and provides us really nice "C"/Python integration. So, regular Python interpreter will load clips6 module, exactly like any other "C"-coded shared module;
2. Before we do anything with CLIPS, we do need to create a CLIPS Environment. Everything in CLIPS is operated inside the Envoronment;
3. Object of type **ENV()** do have a method **DLmodule()**. This method will open extenstion module and load it inside the CLIPS Environment, which creation of all proper functions;
4. The module is written in Python with special Cython extensions;
5. With help of the cmake and it's build environment, we can create appropriate _Makefile_ for building the module;
6. Command _make_ will take the _Makefile_ generated by _cmake_ and will generate compiled shared library, which you shall install somewhere on your filesystem;
7. Path to this shared library is passed to _DLmodule()_ method.

Go (back)[MODULES.md] to the modules documentation.
